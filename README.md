# KiwiJuice56
Hello! I'm a student that is very absorbed in computer science.
I like to pick up plenty of projects and contribute where I can.
My account is mostly a dump of games that I've worked on in the past.
I'm willing to assist with any sort of project related to my experience, especially in game development!
